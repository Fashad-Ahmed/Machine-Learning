Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning and linear regression to find the optimal values of parameters that minimize a cost function. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how gradient descent works in linear regression:

Understanding Linear Regression: Linear regression is a statistical model that predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. It aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the error between the predicted output and the actual output.
Objective of Gradient Descent: In linear regression, the goal is to find the values of the coefficients (weights) that minimize the cost function, which quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Gradient descent is used to iteratively update the coefficients in the direction that reduces the cost function.
Mathematics Behind Gradient Descent: In linear regression, the model aims to find the best values of the coefficients (θ1 and θ2 for univariate linear regression) that minimize the cost function. Initially, the coefficients are randomly selected, and the cost function is calculated. The coefficients are then updated iteratively using the gradient descent algorithm until the cost function reaches its minimum. This process involves calculating the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to the coefficients and using them to update the coefficients.
Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression: The gradient descent algorithm for linear regression can be summarized as follows:
Initialize the coefficients (θ1 and θ2) with random values.
Set the learning rate (α), which determines the size of each update step.
Iterate until convergence:
Calculate the predicted output (hθ(xi)) for each input (xi) using the current coefficients.
Update the coefficients using the following formulas:
θ1 = θ1 - α * (1/m) * ∑(hθ(xi) - yi)
θ2 = θ2 - α * (1/m) * ∑((hθ(xi) - yi) * xi)
Calculate the cost function using the updated coefficients.
Return the final coefficients.

Python Implementation of Gradient Descent: Here is an example of how to implement gradient descent for linear regression in Python:

```
import numpy as np

class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations
        self.coefficients = None

    def fit(self, X, y):
        m, n = X.shape
        self.coefficients = np.zeros(n)

        for _ in range(self.num_iterations):
            predictions = np.dot(X, self.coefficients)
            error = predictions - y
            gradient = (1 / m) * np.dot(X.T, error)
            self.coefficients -= self.learning_rate * gradient

    def predict(self, X):
        return np.dot(X, self.coefficients)

```

This implementation uses the NumPy library for matrix operations. The fit method performs the gradient descent algorithm, and the predict method makes predictions using the learned coefficients.
